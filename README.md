# img2svg

My attempt to convert bitmap images into SVG vector images - very rubbish right now :)

## Usage

```
python main4.py
```

Convert one image in the same directory of the py file, save SVG in the same directory.

options:
`-q` estimated runtime in seconds. (or quality)

`-n_color` num of colors when grouping pixels. If not specified, It'll alter depending on quality.

`-nd` `-no_dots`, no dots.

`-nl` `-no_lines`, no lines.
